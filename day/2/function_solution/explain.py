# For Day 2 P1, converting the letters to ASCII numbers and subtracting them results in the following set of values: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Where the outcome of a match can be mapped to values as follows: 

# Win -> 24 or 21
# Lose -> 22 or 25
# Draw -> 23

# Subtracting 23 from all these values gives us the following:

# Win -> 1 or -2
# Lose -> -1 or 2
# Draw -> 0

# If we lay these values out as x-coordinates, we can find a rounded function that maps the loss values to 0, draw value to 1, and win value to 2. Multiplying the output of this function by 2 gives use either 0, 3, or 6 which is the score for the match.

# We can convert our choice to a score by subtracting the ASCII value of W from X, Y, Z to get a score of 1, 2, or 3.

# A 3D function that accepts two ASCII values and returns a score looks like this!

# z=3 cos(((2 Ï€ (y-x-32))/(3))-2)+1+y-87

s = """
For day 2 part 1, it's possible to represent the outcome of each match as an integer by subtracting the ASCII values of the letters in the input file from each other.

With the right offsets, one can find that the following integers map to the given outcomes:

1 or -2 -> Win
-1 or 2 -> Lose
0 -> Draw

We can find a function that takes these values as input and outputs the score for a match. Rounding the result of the function shown to the nearest integer and multiplying by 3, outputs the correct score 0, 3, or 6 for each match.

It's also possible to define a 3D function that takes two ASCII letters as inputs (x, y) and outputs z: the total score for a match, which also takes into account the points we get (1, 2, or 3) depending on the item we chose.
